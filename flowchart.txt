1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Road Traffic Network Data
3. Data processing
	- Processing using keras to catergical 
	- Processing using Pandas Dataframe
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Splitting the data to train and test for Deep LEarning and Taking X and Y for Machine Learning
7. Building the model
	- Deep Learning
		- CNN
		- CNN+LSTM
		- LSTM
		- BiLSTM
		- RNN
		- GRU
		- CNN with KFoldVaildation  
	- Machine Learning
		- Random Forest
		- Decision Tree
		- KNN
		- Support Vector Machine
		- Voting Classifier  
8. Training the model
9. Building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better accuracy comparing with Other Models 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - Voting Classifier,CNN+LSTM model is build as Extension for feature values
used for prediction since we it gives better accuracy around 100,99 comparing with other Models
